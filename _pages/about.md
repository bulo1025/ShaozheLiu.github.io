I am a graduate student from the [Academy of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies](http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, specializing in Data Science.

- Research interests:
My research interests include Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, and Brain-Computer Interfaces.

- Personal hobbies:
In my free time, I enjoy singing (I was recognized as one of the top 10 singers on campus), playing the piano and guitar, as well as traveling.

- Purpose of pursuing a Ph.D:
There are two main reasons why I am pursuing a Ph.D. Firstly, I have a personal preference for innovative work and hope to make significant contributions in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces and Computer Science. Secondly, I have a strong desire for knowledge and a curiosity towards unknown areas.

- Personal strengths:
There are two strengths that I possess. Firstly, I have clear goals. After completing my graduate studies, I gained two years of work experience, which has further solidified my purpose and motivation in pursuing a Ph.D. Secondly, I have demonstrated a strong learning ability by publishing two papers in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces within a relatively short period of time.
